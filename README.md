## About the Project

The **ZeroBank Selenium Cucumber UI Test Automation** framework is an automated testing solution created to validate
various user scenarios on the ZeroBank platform. Designed to integrate Cucumber for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD),
Selenium for UI automation, and TestNG for test execution and reporting, this framework enables efficient and consistent
testing of core features such as login, payee management, and foreign currency purchases.

Additionally, this project serves as a practical resource for learners who are interested in mastering these
technologies. By providing a real-world application of Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, and Apache POI, the framework allows
users to gain hands-on experience in automated UI testing, data-driven testing, and BDD practices.

## Key Benefits

- **Automated UI Testing**: Tests core functionalities such as login, adding a new payee, and foreign currency purchase.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Test scenarios are defined in a readable format using Cucumber and Gherkin
  syntax.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Tests can be run across different browsers to ensure compatibility.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates HTML and PDF reports with test results, including screenshots of failed scenarios.
- **Data-Driven Testing with Apache POI**: Supports parameterized testing by fetching test data from Excel files,
  leveraging Apache POI for seamless Excel integration. User credentials are retrieved from an Excel file for login
  scenarios, and test results are recorded in an Excel file for detailed tracking.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Simplifies test maintenance by using the POM design pattern.

## Features

- **Login Functionality**: Validates login functionality by retrieving the username and password from an Excel file
  using Apache POI.
- **Add New Payee**: Automates adding a new payee with multiple data inputs.
- **Purchase Foreign Currency**: Tests the currency purchase functionality with various currency types and amounts.
- **Data Table Support with Apache POI**: Uses data tables for parameterized tests, allowing multiple sets of input.
  Apache POI is used to manage test data from Excel files.
- **Extent Reports**: Generates HTML and PDF reports of the test results.
- **Parallel Testing**: Supports parallel execution to speed up test runs.
- **Jenkins Integration**: Easily integrate with Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) processes.

## Application Under Test

The application under test is [ZeroBank](http://zero.webappsecurity.com/login.html), a demo banking application that
provides various financial services. The framework tests functionalities such as login, online banking, and payee
management to ensure these processes work as expected.

## Reporting

Test results are generated in multiple formats:

- **Pretty Console Output**: All runner classes include the `pretty` plugin for clean and readable terminal output.
- **HTML Reports**:
    - `TestRunnerWithPlugin`: Generates a basic HTML report at `target/site/cucumber-pretty.html`.
    - `TestRunnerSmokeWithHtmlAndJson`: Generates a detailed HTML report at `target/reports/smoke-html-report.html`.
- **JSON Report**:
    - `TestRunnerSmokeWithHtmlAndJson`: Creates a JSON report at `target/reports/smoke-json-report.json` for integration with external tools.
- **Extent Report**:
    - `TestRunnerExtentReport`: Uses ExtentCucumberAdapter to generate rich, interactive reports.
    - Location: `test-output/SparkReport/Spark.html`
    - Includes system info like username, timezone, OS, etc.
- **Excel Logging**:
    - Test results (scenario name, status, browser) are logged in an Excel file using Apache POI for detailed tracking.

> Reports are saved under `target/`, `test-output/`, and `testReports/` directories.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Go to **File > New > Project from Version Control**.
    - Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/cihat-kose/zerobank-selenium-cucumber-ui-test-automation.git`.
    - Click **Clone**.

2. **Install necessary plugins**:
    - Ensure **Cucumber for Java** and **Gherkin** plugins are installed in IntelliJ IDEA for Cucumber and Gherkin
      syntax support:
        - Go to **File > Settings > Plugins** (or **Preferences** on macOS).
        - Search for **Cucumber for Java** and **Gherkin**, install them, and restart IntelliJ IDEA if prompted.

3. **Open the project**:
    - IntelliJ IDEA should automatically detect and import the project as a Maven project.
    - Wait for dependencies to download.

## Configuration

- **cucumber.properties**: Configure Cucumber settings in `src/test/resources/cucumber.properties`:
   ```properties
   cucumber.publish.quiet=true
   ```
- **extent.properties**: Configure ExtentReports settings in `src/test/resources/extent.properties`:
   ```properties
   extent.reporter.spark.start=true
   extent.reporter.spark.out=test-output/SparkReport/Spark.html
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run tests**:
    - Open the `src/test/java` directory in IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Right-click on any test file or directory and select **Run 'TestName'**.

2. **Jenkins Integration**:
    - Integrate with Jenkins by creating a Jenkins job, adding a build step to run tests via Maven, and specifying
      `clean test` as the Maven goal.

## Parallel Testing

To run tests in parallel, you can use TestNG XML files such as `ParallelTest.xml`. Right-click on the XML file in
IntelliJ and select **Run 'ParallelTest.xml'**.
